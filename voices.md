# Voices

Echo allows you to have two different types of voices.

You can change and control each voice independently within the settings. You can pick the voice, pitch, rate and volume of the voice. Currently we only support Apple system voices.

## Speaking Voice

Your speaking voice is the voice that is used to communicate with your communication partner. Select the options that you want to represent your voice.

## Cue Voice

Your cue voice is the voice that is used to speak information to you. Select the options the you want to hear when Echo is talking to you. You might want this voice to be faster so you can use the app faster and more efficiently.
