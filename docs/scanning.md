# Scanning

Scanning is when Echo goes through each item in the list automatically.

You can enable scanning in the settings. The other settings have no effect until scanning is enabled.

Scan speed is the speed at which Echo goes through the items in the list. It is measured in seconds its the amount of time that Echo waits after reading an item before it moves on. For example if its set to 2 seconds it will read an item, wait to seconds then move onto the next item.

Scan on app launch means that the app will start automatically scanning as soon as the app is launched. If disabled it will not automatically start

Scan after selection means the app will continue scanning even after you make a selection. If disabled the scanning will stop after you select an item.

Scanning will automatically loop back to the start once it reaches the end. You can adjust how many times it scans through before stopping in the settings.
