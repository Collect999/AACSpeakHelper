# Analytics

We optionally collect some basic analytics about your app usage. You can opt out at any time in the settings. These analytics are completely anonymised so there is no way for us to identify you from the data.&#x20;

We collect data on the following things:

* When the app is opened or closed
* When you anything is read aloud (not the text that is read)
* When you trigger an access method
* When you select a character or letter
* When you complete onboarding

The data is completed only for the purposes of improving the app experiance for everyone.
