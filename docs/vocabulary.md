Echo lets you pick between different vocabularies and even create your own.

You can pick from the list of vocabularies we provide. We suggest you give them all a try and see what best matches your needs. If you would like to edit one of the provided vocabularies then you can 'copy' it by swiping the right on the vocabulary and clicking the 'copy' button. You can then edit this vocabulary.

You can also create a brand new vocabulary from scratch by pressing 'New Vocabulary'.

To edit a vocabulary press the 'edit' button. This will then take you to a screen where you can fully edit the vocabulary. The screenshot below explains what all the buttons do.

Clicking the 'settings' button on a node will show you options for that specific node. You can delete the node or change what is read out by each of the voices, this allows you to have a different cue and speaking text for each node.

You can also chose to change it to a 'spelling' node. This means that when its selected it will enter spelling mode and allow users to type out messages using prediction. Spelling settinsg are controlled directly in the main settings area.

## Importing / Exporting Vocabularies

You can export your vocabularies to a file with the 'export current vocabulary' button. You will get a pop up asking you to save the file. You can then save this file anywhere you want, including off the device or in cloud storage. Just bear in mind that if the vocabulary has private information in it this will then be in the file.

You can then at a later date click the 'import a vocabulary' button which will prompt you to select a file. You can then select a file your previously exported and it will load it into the app and select it as the current vocabulary.

## Extra options

You can chose how much 'history' you wnt to show at once. You can create folders within folders and this lets you decide how many to show at once on the screen. This doesn't effect the functionality of Echo, just what is displayed to users.

You can also decide if you want to show a back button or not within each folder. If you enable this then a Back button will appear at the bottom (or top) of each list, when selected it will take you out of the current folder.
