# Appearance

The app's primary mode of use is without the display for many users but for those who may want to look at the output they made need easier to read text and display elements. As such you can alter the

* Main entries in a list (colour, font, size)
* Current (Highlighted) item (colour, font, size)
* Message bar text and background colour
* And if using, the on-screen arrows

We have some themes that are presets for common colours and sizing. If you wish to set default use "System default"\
\
Please note - we don't allow changing the background colour. This can be white or dark - and use "dark mode" in iOS to do this
