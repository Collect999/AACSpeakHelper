## Swipe Gestures

You can swipe up, down, left or right. You must do the swipe across the main part of the screen for it to register.&#x20;

Swipes trigger the following actions:

* Up - Go back/up in the list
* Down - Go forward/down in the list
* Right - Select the current item
* Left - Remove the previous character
* Tap - Select the current item

You can enable and disable the swipes in the settings

## On Screen Arrows

You can use the on screen arrows to control Echo. You can drag the arrows about the screen to put them somewhere you find convenient.

Arrows trigger the following actions:

* Up - Go back/up in the list
* Down - Go forward/down in the list
* Right - Select the current item
* Left - Remove the previous character

You can enable and disable the arrows in the settings

## External Switches

Echo allows you to use external switches to control the app. To add a new switch go to your access settings and then click add a new switch. You can then click 'detect switch' which will then listen for you to press your switch. This registers the switch and then you can assign it an action.

Possible actions are:

* None - This can be used if you want to register a switch but not have the switch trigger an action
* Go to the next item
* Go to the previous item
* Select the currently selected item
* Delete the last inputted letter
* Clear all the inputted text
* Start scanning from the current item, scanning must be enabled
* Quickly scan through the items - This is only available when holding the switch

## Game Controller

Echo also supports the use of Game Controllers to control the app. [Read Apples official guide on how to connect your game controller to your device.](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/111099) Once you have connected your controller to your device it will appear in the access methods section of the Echo settings. You can then map each button on the controller to do any action you want inside of Echo.&#x20;

A game controller has all the same actions as external switches.
